                    * **ossTopology.managedElementId:** [OPTIONAL]
                    The same as the NetworkElement Managed Object (MO) name.
                    This matches the MeContext MO name, if it exists, and is case sensitive.
                    Some characters are restricted in ENM system models. These cannot be used in the *networkElementId* attribute.
                    The following characters cannot be used:
                      - *=,%{}<>:"/\|?**
                      - *All ASCII characters below or equal to hexadecimal 1F* 
                    
                      If no value is provided, a combination of <cluster-name>-<namespace>-<vnf Instance name> is set for this parameter.

                    * **ossTopology.timeZone:** [OPTIONAL]
                    The local time zone of the node
                    Use the following command to get the appropriate value:
                      ``` cmedit describe NetworkElement.timeZone in ENM ```

                    * **ossTopology.networkElementType:** [REQUIRED]

                    This value will be ignored if ossTopology.snmpVersion is empty or equals SNMP_V3. In this case ENM will set snmpReadCommunity
                    and snmpWriteCommunity for the node to default 'public'. Otherwise, if no value is specified – default 'enm-public' will be set
                    Not applicable for AXE based nodes.

                    * **ossTopology.snmpPort:** [OPTIONAL]
                    SNMP port.

                    For example, for vEPG it would be 830, and for vMME it would be 22.

                    * **ossTopology.subNetworks:** [OPTIONAL]
                    SubNetwork is used for logical grouping of nodes within ENM.
                    It can contain one or more child subnetwork.
                    *For example:*
                      - If only one subNetwork, then the format is: SubNetwork=CL.
                      - If more than one child SubNetwork, the format is SubNetwork=CL,SubNetwork=COMS. That is SubNetwork has to be separated by a comma (,).

                    * **ossTopology.transportProtocol:** [OPTIONAL]

    InstantiateVnfRequest:
      description: |
        Additional params in Instantiate Vnf Request represents
        a list of key-value pairs. The order of the pairs
        in the list is not significant. In JSON, a set of
        key-value pairs is represented as an object.
        
        **The supported EVNFM additional parameters:**
        
        * **namespace:** [OPTIONAL]
        The namespace the application is to be deployed into. 
        **Note:** The same namespace cannot be selected as EVNFM or any Kubernetes initialized namespaces
                  (default, kube-system, kube-public, kube-node-lease) or cluster's crd namespace. If selected the request will be rejected.
        
        * **cleanUpResources:** [OPTIONAL]
        Removes the resources on the cluster that are associated with the application, including the Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) and Persistent Volumes (PV).
        **Defaulted to true.**
        This option also removes the namespace if no other VNF is instantiated within that namespace.
        **Note:** cleanUpResources removes the PVC and PV only when the resources have the Kubernetes instance label (app.kubernetes
        .io/instance: <RELEASE_NAME>).
        
        * **applicationTimeOut:** [OPTIONAL]
        The maximum time allocated for the application to instantiate.
        This is the maximum time required for the application regardless of the number of charts to be installed.
        When the instantiate request is sent, each command resolves its timeout based on how long is left in the overall applicationTimeOut. 
        For multiple charts, each subsequent chart resolves its timeout from the remainder of the overall applicationTimeOut.
        *Defaulted* to 3600s
        ***Example:*** 2 charts with a timeout of 200 seconds.
        The first chart timeout is 200 seconds. If it completes within 50 seconds, the second chart is instantiated with a timeout of 150 seconds.
        **Note:** If cleanUpResources is specified and a chart fails; then applicationTimeOut is reset to its original value and used 
                  for the terminate operation. 
        
        * **skipVerification:** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to bypass the application verification checks.
        If set, LCM operation will trigger helm operation on the cluster, but will not check for instantiated objects state and
        wait for them to get up and running. This flag cannot be set to true if CMPv2Enrollment and addNodeToOss are set to true,
        otherwise the request is considered a bad request. **Defaulted to false**
        **Note:** Setting skipVerification = true may lead to the absence of day0 secrets configuration during the pod instantiation process, 
        because secrets may be deleted before helm operation is actually completed.
        
        * **skipJobVerification:** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to bypass verification of Pods created as part of Job.
        **Defaulted to false**
        
        * **disableOpenapiValidation** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to validate rendered templates against the Kubernetes OpenAPI Schema.
        **Defaulted to true**
        
        * **helmWait:** [OPTIONAL]
        If set, waits until all pods, PVC, services, and minimum number of pods of a deployment are in a ready state before marking 
        the release as successful. The wait time resolves its timeout from the remainder of the overall applicationTimeOut.
        **Defaulted to false**
        
        * **retrieveUnsealKey** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to perform KMS interactions during instantiation.
        **Defaulted to true**
        
        * **helmNoHooks** [OPTIONAL]
        If set, adds --no-hooks to **helm** command
        **Defaulted to false**

        Request with additional parameters represents a list of key-value pairs.
        The order of the pairs in the list is not significant. In JSON, a set of
        key-value pairs is represented as an object. It shall comply
        with the provisions  defined in clause 4 of IETF RFC 7159.

        The supported EVNFM additional parameters:
        * **applicationTimeOut:** [OPTIONAL] Maximum time allocated for application instantiation
        (Defaulted to 3600s)
        When the package has multiple helm charts, the specified timeout will be multiplied by the number of helm charts
        * **skipVerification:** [OPTIONAL] Flag indicating whether to bypass the Application Verification Checks (Defaulted to false)
        * **helmWait:** [OPTIONAL] If set, will wait until all Pods, PVCs, Services,
        and minimum number of Pods of a Deployment are in a ready state before marking the release as
        successful. It will wait for as long as specified by applicationTimeOut.
        * **helmNoHooks** [OPTIONAL] If set, will add --no-hooks to helm command
        * **skipJobVerification:** [OPTIONAL] Flag indicating whether to bypass verification of Pods created as part of Job. (Defaulted to false)
        * **disableOpenapiValidation** [OPTIONAL] Flag to disable validation of objects going to be created against Kubernetes OpenAPI.
        (Defaulted to true)

        Application specific values:
        These parameters are optional and only required for certain situations. Values can be overwritten here.

        This type represents a list of key-value pairs.
        The order of the pairs in the list is not significant.
        In JSON, a set of key-value pairs is represented as an object.

        **The supported EVNFM additional parameters:**

        * **applicationTimeOut:** [OPTIONAL]
        Maximum time allocated for the application to change package.
        **Defaulted to 3600s**
        This is the maximum time required for the application regardless of the number of charts to be installed.
        When the change package request is sent, each command resolves its timeout based on how long is left in the overall applicationTimeOut.
        For multiple charts, each subsequent chart resolves its timeout from the remainder of the overall applicationTimeOut.

        **Example:** 2 charts with a timeout of 200 seconds.
        The first chart timeout is 200 seconds. If it completes within 50 seconds, the second chart is instantiated with a timeout of 150 seconds.

        **Note:** 	If any chart fails; then applicationTimeOut is reset for the rollback operation.

        * **skipVerification:** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to bypass the application verification checks.
        If set, LCM operation will trigger helm operation on the cluster, but will not check for instantiated objects state 
        and wait for them to get up and running. **Defaulted to false**

        * **skipJobVerification:** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to bypass verification of Pods created as part of Job.
        **Defaulted to false**

        * **disableOpenapiValidation** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to validate rendered templates against the Kubernetes OpenAPI Schema
        **Defaulted to true**

        * **skipMergingPreviousValues** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to bypass merging values from previous release.
        **Defaulted to false**

        * **helmWait:** [OPTIONAL]
        If set, will wait until all Pods, PVCs, Services,
        and minimum number of Pods of a Deployment are in a ready state before marking the release as
        successful. The wait time resolves its timeout from the remainder of the overall applicationTimeOut.
        **Defaulted to false**

        * **helmNoHooks** [OPTIONAL]
        If set, adds --no-hooks to **helm** command
        **Defaulted to false**

        * **persistScaleInfo** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to persist the scale information from the current instance in the upgraded instance.
        If set to true, any scaling aspects and VNF controlled scaling extensions shared between the current package and the target package 
        are preserved after an upgrade. If set to false, the default values specified in the target package VNFD are used
        **Defaulted to true**

        * **helm_client_version** [OPTIONAL]
        Version used for Instantiate is used for all subsequent LCM operations.
        Defaulted at "3.8". Valid values: "3.8, "3.10", "3.12", "3.13", "3.14" and "latest" (latest supported by EVNFM, currently - 3.14).

        * **persistDMConfig** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to persist the deplyable modules configuration from the current instance in the upgraded instance.
        If this value is true, then configurations of deployable modules from target package (VNFD/API) will be replaced
        with configurations from source package. If set to false, the default values specified in the target package VNFD are used
        **Defaulted to false**
        
        * **upgrade.downsize.allowed** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to a non rolling upgrade will be performed and all replicas and replicasets will be set to zero before the upgrade.
        If this value is true, a non rolling upgrade will be performed and all replicas and replicasets will be set to zero before the upgrade. 
        If set to false, a non rolling upgrade will be performed, but all replicas and replicasets will not be set to zero before the upgrade.
        
        * **isAutoRollbackAllowed** [OPTIONAL]
        Flag indicating whether to allow auto-rollback on failed upgrade operation.
        If this value is true, enables auto rollback when an upgrade has failed which leaves the upgrade operation in a rolled back state. 
        If set to false, disables auto rollback when an upgrade has failed which leaves the upgrade operation in a failed state.
        
        * **upgrade_failed_parameters** [OPTIONAL]
        This parameter is used to set all parameters required to rollback the operation in case of upgrade failure. 
        Any parameters specified within this map will be used in conjunction with the rollback_at_failure_pattern. 
        If the rollback_at_failure_pattern contains keys instantiate/upgrade then parameters from this map will be sent down as part of the request. 
        Can only be used if isAutoRollbackAllowed is set to false. Will be ignored otherwise.
